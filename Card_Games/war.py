""" Let's play a game of war!
The rules are simple:
- Deal to each player until the deck is gone.
    For each round:
    - Each person plays a card
    - The high card takes all those cards and adds them to the bottom of their hand
    - If two or more people tie then they go to war
        - Each player in the war places three cards face-down
        - They flip a fourth card and the high card wins
        - If still tied they go to war again until there is a winner
- Whoever takes all the cards wins

Card values notes:
- Aces are high
- Deuces beat aces
